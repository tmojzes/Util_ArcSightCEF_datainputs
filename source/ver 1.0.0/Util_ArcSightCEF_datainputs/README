1. Introduction

This is the optional accessory for the Technology Add-on for ArcSight CEF data inputs. The utility is meant to be deployed on the Splunk heavy forwarders, Splunk indexer nodes (if there are CEF data streams directly reaching the indexer nodes), or used in all-in-one instances (primarily in develop environments).

2. Installations

This utility can be installed by following the standard Splunk app installation procedures, if you accept the default settings and do not want to make any changes. Alternatively, you can following the document and customize the utility before the deployments.

3. Limitations

This utility is not compatible with any existing apps and add-ons which also perform the index time sourcetype and source renamings.
