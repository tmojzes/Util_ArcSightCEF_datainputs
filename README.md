# Util_ArcSightCEF_datainputs
This is the optional accessory for the Technology Add-on for HP ArcSight CEF data inputs. The utility is meant to be deployed on the Splunk heavy forwarders, Splunk indexer nodes (if there are CEF data streams directly reaching the indexer nodes), or used in all-in-one instances (primarily in develop environments).
